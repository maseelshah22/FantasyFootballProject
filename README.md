# Football Data Scraper 🏈

## Overview 📋
Welcome to the Football Data Scraper Repository! This project was developed with the intention on trying to find the best players to draft in fantasy football using analytics. Users have the ability to select a specific season and positions for data retrieval, as well as the ability for fantasy football performance data to be calculated as well. All data is then exported to an excel sheet in the user's download's folder on their computer for data analysis. Users can then use this data to help them determine which players they think would be most beneficial for their fantasy football team for the upcoming season!

## Design 👨‍💻
