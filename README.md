# Football Data Scraper 🏈

## Overview 📋
Welcome to the Football Data Scraper Repository! This initiative was created to help football fans identify top fantasy football draft picks through the power of analytics. Users can conveniently choose a particular season and player positions for data retrieval, with the added feature of calculating fantasy football performance metrics. Then, all the data is exported to an Excel sheet, conveniently saved in the user's download folder for in-depth analysis. This data can be a valuable resource for users seeking to make informed decisions when selecting players for their fantasy football teams for the upcoming season!
